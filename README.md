Iron Kaggle
LETS COMPETE! Before you jump further, we want you to have an end-to-end experience of solving
a Machine Learning problem.
So let’s try and predict the sales of shops, shall we?
You have a dataset containing information on shops’ sales per day (and several characteristics of
them) - your goal is to predict the sales!

Training data (640841 entries): we will share with you a training set of store sales per day, with bits of
information of what happened in that day in that store.
Real-Life Data (+70k entries): we will also share with you entries without the sales. This will be used (on the
teachers side) to verify how good your model really is!

Expected Deliver:
● “Real-life data set” with an extra column called “sales”, with your predictions (in .csv)
● An expected value of R2 of performance of your model
● A 5’ presentation on the choices you did and the road you took

Schedule:
● 8am: Introduction, Group organization, framing the problem
● 8.30am: Development time
● 1pm: Lunch break
● 2pm: You will receive the “real-life” data
● 2pm: Development time + presentation creation
● 4.30pm: Delivery of the real life data
● 430pm-5pm: Finish your presentation
● 5pm: presentations + winner announcement

DELIVERABLE:
• A .csv file called with your groupd name (e.g, ‘G1.csv’, ‘G2.csv’)
• The value of R2 you are expecting to get
• Send this in a .zip file containing two elements:
• the csv file
• a txt file with the R2 score inside

Winners:
● Winner 1 -> Group with the highest R2 score
● Winner 2 -> Group with the most correct prediction of their own R2 score
BOTH CAN BE THE SAME GROUP
